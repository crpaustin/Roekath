### About This
This is an idea that I had for a web game that was way beyond my ability. Nevertheless, I wanted to include it because it gave me a chance to learn about some of the complexities involved when dealing with multi-client asynchronous games and organization of large projects. I'd begun to look into node.js before I had to move onto other projects. I did however manage to organize a decent bit of information on what I wanted to do with the game and what the world would be like. You can open the link above in order to see what I came up with. I compiled only a little bit of code which can be found in this GitHub project, but there was nothing that I would call noteworthy.
